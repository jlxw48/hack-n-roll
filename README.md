# HackNRoll 2022 - Split Da Bill

## Inspiration
It is a hassle to split bills after a day out with friends! Calculations of who has to pay whom always gets messy.

## What it does
Splits the bills!

## How we built it
Using React.js and much CSS. Also did research on algorithms to efficiently split the bill to keep number of transactions low.

## Challenges we ran into
Designing an efficient algorithm to minimise number of transactions. Also, as usual, CSS was a pain.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Correctness of split, as well as minimalistic looking web application!

## What's next for Split Da Bill
Add automation e.g. to send find output message to Telegram, so that we can forward into group chats.
